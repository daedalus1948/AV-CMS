## Additional Information

This application has been built to test the RBAC permission model. It is not intended for production.

## Security --NOT INTENDED FOR PRODUCTION--

1) User passwords are hashed and salted with the bcrypt module.
2) Data is further sanitized by the Sequelize ORM Models, raw queries are escaped to prevent SQL injections.
3) User forms are sanitized with the validator module to prevent basic XSS.
4) User forms are generated with the csrf token generated by the csurf module to prevent CSRF.
5) Authentication is implemented via session cookies, session ID is generated by the crypto module.

## Instructions

To start the application, clone the repository and 'npm install' 
all the necessary dependencies specified in the package.json file.

1) Configure .env file in the root directory of this project, follow (copy) the example_env.txt file structure.
2) Run the following command - "npm run start-dev" to start the server/application.

## Notes

Due to nature of how the multer package currently is configured, submitted files are always uploaded.
However, further resource manipulation depends on the RBAC permission system.
